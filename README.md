# Cybersecurity-journey-2025

Learning log and code repository for building strong **foundations** in C programming, cybersecurity basics, and digital logic during winter 2025.

An undergraduate engineering/computer science student working through C fundamentals, cybersecurity concepts, and systems thinking. This repo documents the daily progress during Phase 0 (Dec 25 – Jan 5) and beyond.

## Why this repo exists

- **Track daily progress** from Dec 25, 2024 onwards through Phase 0 and future phases.
- **Keep all code organized** — daily practice, mini-projects, notes, and resources in one place.
- **Build a visible portfolio** to show consistency, real work, and growth over time.
- **Establish habits** — get comfortable with Git and version control (used in every real job).
- **Accountability** — public repo makes it easier to stay consistent and motivated.

## 2025 main goals

### Phase 0: Winter Break (25 Dec – 5 Jan)

**Focus:** C fundamentals, OOP intro, digital logic, IT Act 2000, forensics basics, and creating sustainable study habits.

**Target outcomes:**
- ✅ Master: pointers, strings, structures, file I/O, function pointers, basic OOP concepts
- ✅ Build 8–10 small C projects (Password Strength Rater, Student Records, Employee Management System, etc.)
- ✅ Study notes on: digital logic, number systems, Boolean algebra, IT Act 2000 (India), forensics intro
- ✅ Daily commit habit established (code every day, push to GitHub)
- ✅ 30–40 total coding hours logged

### Later phases (Jan – Dec 2025)

- Advanced C/C++ projects (sockets, basic encryption, multi-threading)
- Cybersecurity deep-dive: worms, phishing, viruses, injection attacks, secure coding practices
- Physics concepts (EM waves, optics, signal analysis) tied to networking and systems
- Prepare for Google Cybersecurity Certificate or IBM certifications
- Contribute to or build small open-source security tools

## Daily routine

1. **Code:** Write at least one C file per day (even small practice counts).
   - Follow the day-wise folder structure
   - Keep files well-commented

2. **Commit:** Push to GitHub with a meaningful message.
   - Example: `Day 2: Pointers Part 1 + memory basics`
   - Example: `Mini-project: Password Strength Rater v1`

3. **Track:** Update `notes/progress-log.md` with:
   - What you learned today
   - Minutes spent coding
   - Topics struggled with or mastered
   - Code files or resources used

4. **Reflect:** Once a week, review gaps and adjust next week's focus.

## Tech stack & tools

- **Language:** C (primary), C++ (later)
- **Compiler:** MinGW (GCC on Windows)
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **OS:** Linux Mint (primary) + Windows (secondary)
- **Version control:** Git + GitHub
- **Note-taking:** Markdown files in this repo
- **Problem-solving:** HackerRank, LeetCode (C category)

## Resources used

- **Pointers & Advanced C:** Tutorialspoint, Programiz C tutorials
- **Digital Logic:** Khan Academy, Ben Eater (YouTube)
- **IT Act 2000:** Official Indian government docs
- **Cybersecurity basics:** TryHackMe, OverTheWire Wargames
- **OOP concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming with C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup basics)

## Phase 0 progress tracker

### Setup & Planning (25 Dec)
- [x] GitHub repo created (`cybersecurity-journey-2025`)
- [x] README written with goals
- [x] VS Code + MinGW installed & tested
- [ ] First code file committed
- [ ] First mini-project started

### Learning milestones
- [ ] Pointers basics mastered (Day 1–2)
- [ ] Strings & memory management (Day 3–4)
- [ ] Structures & file I/O (Day 5–6)
- [ ] Function pointers & callbacks (Day 7–8)
- [ ] Mini-projects complete (Days 9+)
- [ ] Phase 0 reflection written

## Key learning objectives

### C Programming
- [ ] Understand memory layout (stack, heap, global)
- [ ] Master pointer arithmetic and dereferencing
- [ ] Work with dynamic memory (malloc, free, realloc)
- [ ] File operations (open, read, write, close)
- [ ] Structures and linked lists
- [ ] Function pointers and callbacks

### Cybersecurity & Systems
- [ ] IT Act 2000 sections (crimes, penalties, digital signatures)
- [ ] Basic forensics (evidence gathering, chain of custody)
- [ ] Common attacks (buffer overflow, SQL injection, phishing)
- [ ] Password security and hashing
- [ ] Network basics (IP, ports, protocols)

### Digital Logic
- [ ] Number systems (binary, hex, decimal conversion)
- [ ] Boolean algebra and logic gates
- [ ] Combinational circuits
- [ ] Sequential circuits and state machines
- [ ] Binary arithmetic

## Commit message convention

Keep commits clean and meaningful:
- `Day N: Topic - Brief description`
- `Mini-project: Project name - Feature added`
- `Notes: Topic - Summary of what was added`
- `Fix: Issue fixed`

Example:
Day 3: Pointers - pointer arithmetic and dereferencing practice

Notes: Digital Logic - truth tables and De Morgan's laws

## How to use this repo

1. **Daily coding:** Each day, create a folder `dayX/` and add your C files there.
2. **Weekly review:** Update `notes/progress-log.md` with what you learned and time spent.
3. **Mini-projects:** Once you finish a small project, create a folder under `phase0/mini-projects/` with code and a short README.
4. **Track progress:** Use the checkboxes above to mark what you've completed.
5. **Share & reflect:** At the end of Phase 0 (Jan 5), write a reflection in `notes/phase0-reflection.md`.

## Time commitment

- **Daily target:** 5–7 hours (mix of coding, studying, problem-solving)
- **Weekly target:** 35–49 hours
- **Phase 0 target:** 30–40 hours total
- **Tracking:** Log minutes spent daily in `progress-log.md`

## Notes for future phases

After Phase 0 (Jan 5), this README will be updated with:
- Total hours logged and projects completed
- Strongest and weakest topics
- Detailed plan for Phase 1 (Jan 6 – Feb 2)
